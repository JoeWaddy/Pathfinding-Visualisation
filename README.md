# Pathfinding-Visualisation
This is my first attempt at creating a visual path-finding algorithm in Javascript (Node.js and p5.js) which allows the user to interact.

## Information
__A* Search__: Considered to be the best pathfinding algorithm. This is the only algorithm used so far, but future updates will allow the user to choose an algorithm of their choice, and compare their methods.

A random selection of walls can be set using the button on the page. Furthermore, walls can be added or removed manually to create a custom maze for the algorithm to work through. Start and end nodes are preset, but can be adjusted by the user. Once ready to run, you can click the start button.
